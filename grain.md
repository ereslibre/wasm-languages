# Grain in WebAssembly

Grain is a functional programming language that is designed specifically to compile to WebAssembly.
We have enjoyed using it because of its intuitive syntax and great tooling.


## Uses

Grain can be used in the browser. It also supports WASI, so it can be used for the Fermyon Platform (Wagi and Spin) or with commandline runners like Wasmtime.


## Available Implementations

Grain has an [official implementation](https://grain-lang.org/) that supports Wasm and WASI out of the box.
